Hi, I hope your are doing well.
All aspects of the program work including res, cancel, seats, list, resfcl etc
for reserving and cancelling a seat for a passenger, you need to follow respsngr AC123 parsa 3
that means first put respsngr/cnclpsngr + space + flightnumber + space+ name + space+ an integer that represents a passport number

if you want to print the passengers that are on a flight you need to put psgnrs AC123
if you want to cancel a passenger's reservation you have to do cnclpsngr AC123 parsa 3.
